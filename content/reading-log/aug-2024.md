## Programming

- [Rust Deep Dive: Borked Vtables and Barking Cats][rust-barking-cats]
  - Unsafely accessing and manipulating the vtable of dyn traits in Rust.
- [Go Data Structures: Interfaces][go-ifaces]
  - How Go interfaces work under the hood.
- [fast-check: how it works][fc-internals]
  - A deep dive into the internals of property-based testing frameworks; I really enjoyed the discussion of shrinking (which still feels like pure magic, even after learning how it's implemented!)

## Math

- [A wonderful coincidence or an expected connection: why $\pi^2 \approx g$][pi-squared-approx-g]

  - I'd always written off $\pi^2 \approx 9.87$ being close to $g = \pu{9.81 m s^-2}$ as a fluke of
    nature, but this is not so---the meter was originally defined by the length of a pendulum with
    period $\pu{2 s}$, and hence
    $$ T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{L}{g} $$
  means at some point $\pi^2$ was _exactly_ equal to $g$ expressed in $\pu{m s^-2}$.
