## Programming

- [Notes on structured concurrency, or: Go statement considered harmful][go-stmt-considered-harmful]
- [ReDoS "vulnerabilities" and misaligned incentives][redos]
- [You might want to use panics for error handling][use-panics]
  - The post is (probably intentionally) misleading named: the author agrees that `Result`'s interface
    is preferable to exceptions but posits that handling the error case by unwinding instead of manually
    propagating up the call stack is a better implementation strategy.
- [Algorithms for Modern Hardware][hpc]
  - Only skimmed the instruction parallelism and memory sections; on my bucket list to come back and
    follow the code more closely some day.
- [CPU Cache][cpu-cache]
  - I've been meaning to read about CPU caches for some time; the post below on false sharing
    popping up on my HN feed finally pushed me to do it. My takeaways:
    - Modern CPUs comprise multiple cores, which can run concurrently.
    - Accessing RAM is slow, so there are various hardware caches that are physically closer to
      cores and store recently accessed data.
    - Caches are arranged in levels: L1 is fastest to access, is usually per-core, and has the smallest size.
      L2 cache is larger but slower to access, and so on. Since some cache levels are per-core, there needs to
      be some synchronization mechanism (ensuring _cache coherence_.)
    - Within a cache, data is organized along cache lines---chunks of contiguous memory; when reading an address, the whole cache line is loaded.

- [Rust Deep Dive: Borked Vtables and Barking Cats][rust-barking-cats]
  - Unsafely accessing and manipulating the vtable of dyn trait objects in Rust.
    For fun, I then [did the same thing in Go](https://go.dev/play/p/KG0CHGD1GST).
- [Go Data Structures: Interfaces][go-ifaces]
- [fast-check: how it works][fc-internals]
  - A deep dive into the internals of property-based testing frameworks; I really enjoyed the discussion of shrinking (which still feels like pure magic, even after learning how it's implemented!)

## Math and Science

- [Quanta: Mathematicians Prove Hawking Wrong About the Most Extreme Black Holes][black-holes]
- [A wonderful coincidence or an expected connection: why $\pi^2 \approx g$][pi-squared-approx-g]

  - I'd always written off $\pi^2 \approx 9.87$ being close to $g = \pu{9.81 m s^-2}$ as a fluke of
    nature, but this is not so---the meter was originally defined by the length of a pendulum with
    period $\pu{2 s}$, and hence
    $$ T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{L}{g} $$
  means at some point $\pi^2$ was _exactly_ equal to $g$ expressed in $\pu{m s^-2}$.
