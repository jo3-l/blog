Hi! I'm Joseph Liu, a computer science student from Canada. Starting Fall 2024, I'll be studying at
the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/); before that, I graduated from the [IB
Diploma program](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/) in high school with 45/45
points.

Besides programming, I also enjoy writing, playing tennis, and the very occasional anime/manga; my
favorite anime this year was Frieren.

## Programming experience and projects

Nowadays, I primarily work with Rust and Go on backend projects; however, I also have experience in
Python, TypeScript, Java, and C++ among other technologies.

I am a [frequent contributor][yag-contributions] to the open-source YAGPDB Discord bot in Go,
focusing on its custom templating engine. Notably, I implemented multiple language features such as
`break`, `continue`, and error-handling constructs in the production interpreter, and am currently
working on improving editor integration via a [language server in Rust](https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp).
As part of the latter project, I implemented an [error-tolerant and lossless parser][yag-template-syntax]
by hand, integrated with [rowan](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rowan).

A selection of other interesting projects I created or am involved in:

- [obscenity](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity): A robust profanity detection library for Node.js
  written in TypeScript. It implements a extensible transformer-based design and is thoroughly
  unit-tested. Used by hundreds of open-source projects with 20k+ weekly downloads on npm and 500k+
  downloads total.
- [vsHacks](https://vshacks.github.io/): In high school, I co-founded vsHacksâ€”a now-annual hackathon
  organized by my programming club in collaboration with other schools across Greater Vancouver. I
  contributed extensively to the hackathon website and helped run workshops during the event, which
  saw 50+ participants from the district and beyond.
- [markpdf](https://github.com/jo3-l/markpdf): A command-line utility to edit PDF bookmarks using a
  convenient indentation-based format, built in Go.
- [liftoff](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff): An interpreter for a toy programming language, built
  with Python.
