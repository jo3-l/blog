Hi! I'm Joseph Liu, a computer science student from Canada. Starting Fall 2024, I'll be studying at
the University of Waterloo; before that, I graduated from the IB Diploma program in the May 2024
session with 45/45 points.

I love to program in my free time, and have built and contributed to various projects over the
years---more on those below. Besides programming, I also enjoy [reading](/reading-log), writing,
playing tennis, and the occasional anime/manga; my favorite anime this year was Frieren.

## Programming experience and projects

Nowadays, I primarily work with Rust and Go on backend projects; however, I also have experience in
Python, TypeScript, Java, and C++ among other technologies.

I am a [longtime contributor][yag-contributions] to the open-source YAGPDB Discord bot in Go,
focusing on improving its custom templating engine. Notably, I implemented multiple language
features such as loop control flow actions (`break`, `continue`) and error-handling constructs, and
am currently working on improving editor integration via a [language server in
Rust](https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp) with tower-lsp. As part of the latter project, I
implemented an [error-tolerant and lossless parser][yag-template-syntax] generating a CST with rowan.

Some of my other projects include:

- [obscenity](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity): A robust profanity detection library for Node.js
  written in TypeScript. It implements an extensible transformer-based design and is thoroughly
  tested with Vitest and fast-check. Obscenity is used by hundreds of open-source projects, and has
  been downloaded 700k+ times total on npm.
- [vsHacks](https://vshacks.github.io/): I co-founded vsHacksâ€”a now-annual hackathon organized by my
  programming club in collaboration with other high schools across Greater Vancouver. I contributed
  extensively to the hackathon website and helped run workshops during the event, which saw 50+
  participants from the district and beyond.
- [markpdf](https://github.com/jo3-l/markpdf): A command-line utility to edit PDF bookmarks using a
  convenient indentation-based format, built in Go.
- [liftoff](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff): An interpreter for a toy programming language, built
  with Python. Though basic, the language is sufficiently complete to build some [interesting programs](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff/blob/main/examples/ccc21j5.rk).
- [yagpdb-cc](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): A community collection of custom commands for
  YAGPDB. I created and continue to maintain this project, having reviewed submissions from 30+
  contributors over the years. I've also built some
  [supporting](https://github.com/jo3-l/yagfuncdata)
  [automation](https://github.com/jo3-l/action-check-yag-tmpl-syntax) which has seen use in other
  YAGPDB-related projects.
