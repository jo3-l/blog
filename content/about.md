Hey there! I'm Joe L., a high school student and programming enthusiast from Canada.
On the web, I usually go by some variation of "Joe" like "jo3-l".

You might know me in real life (in which case, hello there!) or from [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz), where I'm a bot admin and frequent contributor.

These days, I primarily work with Go on backend projects, but I'am also reasonably proficient with TypeScript, Python, Java, and C++, amongst other languages.
Some of the more interesting projects I've worked on are [a toy programming language](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff), [a robust profanity filter](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity),
and a [general-purpose Discord bot](https://github.com/jo3-l/spectre).

Outside of tech, my primary interests are mathematics, tennis, and hiking.

If you'd like to chat and have me friended on Discord, send me a direct message; I respond quickest there.
Otherwise, your best bet is likely email: `jo3 [dot] l [dot] dev [at] outlook [dot] com`.
