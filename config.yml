    title: Hi there!
    content: |
      I'm Joseph Liu, a first-year CS student at the University of Waterloo.
      Welcome to my small slice of the web :) Here, I occasionally blog about math, programming, and
      whatever else piques my interest.

      If you would like to know more about me or my projects, head over to my [about page](/about).
      To contact me, email me at `jliu1602 [at] gmail.com`; I am also active on Discord as `jo3_l`.
