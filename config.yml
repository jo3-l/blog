    title: Hey there!
    content: |
      I'm Joseph Liu, an incoming computer science undergraduate at the University of Waterloo.
      Welcome to my small slice of the web :) Here, I occasionally blog about math, programming, and
      whatever else piques my interest.

      If you would like to know more about me, head over to my [about page](/about). To contact me,
      email me at `jliu1602 [at] gmail.com`; I am also active on Discord as `jo3_l`.
